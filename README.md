# NIRA Stack
A tech stack play initialism, NIRA is also the name of my daughter.
NIRA:
<ul>
<li>N: Node.js (server-side JavaScript runtime environment)</li>
<li>I: Ionic (open-source UI toolkit for building mobile and web apps)</li>
<li>R: React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)</li>
<li>A: Apache Cassandra (distributed NoSQL database)</li>
</ul>

Naming the initialism took me ages, now I need to learn how to use Ionic and Apache Cassandra...
