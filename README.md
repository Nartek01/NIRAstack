# NIRA Stack
A tech stack play initialism, NIRA is also the name of my daughter.
NIRA:
N: Node.js (server-side JavaScript runtime environment)
I: Ionic (open-source UI toolkit for building mobile and web apps)
R: React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
A: Apache Cassandra (distributed NoSQL database)

Naming the initialism took me ages, now I need to learn how to use Ionic and Apache Cassandra...
